# AuditTrail

### AI-Powered Security Control Assessor

AuditTrail is a GRC portfolio tool that uses Claude AI to assess security controls against major compliance frameworks. Paste in a control description or system detail and instantly receive assessment questions, evidence requirements, potential weaknesses with remediation recommendations, and framework control mappings — the same outputs a senior GRC analyst would produce manually.

## What It Does

| Output | What It Means |
|---|---|
| Risk Score (1-10) | Overall risk level of the described control |
| Control Maturity | How mature the control is (Initial → Optimizing) |
| Assessment Questions | Interview questions an auditor would ask |
| Evidence to Collect | Artifacts and screenshots needed for an audit package |
| Weaknesses & Recommendations | Gaps identified with specific remediation steps |
| Framework Mappings | Which official controls apply, with rationale |

### Example Input
```
Our AWS environment uses IAM roles with least-privilege policies attached to all 
EC2 instances and Lambda functions. There are no IAM users with programmatic access 
keys in production. MFA is enforced on all human IAM users via a Service Control 
Policy at the AWS Organizations level. CloudTrail is enabled in all regions with 
logs shipped to a centralized S3 bucket with Object Lock enabled.
